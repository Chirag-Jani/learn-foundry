## What we gon build??

1. Relative Stability : Anchored or Pegged to USD ($1.00) (Floating ones are better though)
   1. How can we do it??
      1. Using Chainlink Pricefeed
      2. Get the pricefeed and change the ETH & BTC for the equivalent $$ value or price
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting) : Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   1. People can only mint stable coin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral : Exogenous (Crypto) 
   1. ETH (Wrapped)
   2. BTC (Wrapped)
