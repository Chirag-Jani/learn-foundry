# Stablecoin Notes (PC F23)

What are Stablecoins?
- Stablecoin is a crypto assest whose buying power fluctuates very little relative to the rest of the market

Why do we care?
- Coz money is important and serves 3 functions,
  - Storage of Value
  - Unit of account
  - Medium of Exchange

Catagories?
- Relative Stability (Pegged/Anchored or Floating)
  - Tether, USDC, and DAI uses US Doller at pegging
  - [RAI]([https://](https://www.coinbase.com/price/rai)) is a Floating Type of stablecoin 
- Stability Method (Governed or Algorithmic)
  - This is mostly dependent on minting and burning of the coin
  - In governed, there is a specific governing body responsible for minting and burning of the coin
    - These are typically considered centralized 
    - DAO could be the governing body
  - Algorithmic is the one whose stability is maintained by a permissionless algo. with NO HUMAN INTERVENTION
    - DAI, RAI, FRAX
- Collateral Type (Endogenous or Exogenous)
  - Exogenous collateral is which that originates from outside the protocol
  - Endogenous is when the collateral originates from inside the protocol
  - If the stablecoin fails, does the underlying collateral also fails?
    - Yes ? -> Endogenous
    - No ? -> Exogenous
  - Was the collateral created with the sole purpose of being collateral?
  - Does the protocol own the issuance of the underlying collateral?


- If you want to create $60B worth of Exogenous stablecoin, you would need to onboard $60B worth of collateral. 
- Whereas, you'd need to onboard $0 in case of Endogenous.
